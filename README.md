## Getting Started
First off you need to have Yarn and Node.js on your computer. Yarn is a package manager for your code. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.

You can install Yarn through the Homebrew package manager. This will also install Node.js if it is not already installed.

```sh
$ brew install yarn
```
