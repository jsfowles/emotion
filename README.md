# Belly
--------------------
Belly is a React application designed to make spinning up front end projects quick and easy as
possible. It is developed and maintained by the team at Underbelly Creative.

#### Project Ethos
- **Server rendered** by default, meaning that we have a server that we can offload things like environment variables and API requests.
- A strong **component library** that gives designers the ability to effectively eliminate UI design from parts of product development. Using pre-existing UI, product managers and engineers can scaffold incremental features. The design team can look at and approve these changes while focusing on larger features.
- **Efficiency** is key, you should be able to clone, edit and deploy quickly and easily. This will help designers and engineers to be on-boarded faster.
- It is **strongly typed** with Flow.
- It is **well tested** with Jest and Enzyme.
- There is a **clear and consistant** pattern that will consist of views, components, containers and identity.

## Getting Started
First off you need to have Yarn and Node.js on your computer. Yarn is a package manager for your code. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.

You can install Yarn through the Homebrew package manager. This will also install Node.js if it is not already installed. Just open your terminal and run the command below (minus the $).

```sh
$ brew install yarn
```
